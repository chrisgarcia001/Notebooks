    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The Smart Scale methodology is intended to provide an objective, transparent, and consistent way to evaluate and compare the benefits of competing transportation projects in Virginia. This study provides a statistical analysis of a set of 404 projects scored using the Smart Scale methodology. The study's first goal was to provide a basic characterization of the Smart Scale score distribution across different project features, while the second goal was to answer the following two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Was the Smart Scale methodology applied consistently across all projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If Accessibility (a key concern for the Fredericksburg area) was prioritized in Smart Scale score calculation for area types A and D (the area types where Fredericksburg projects occur), how would this impact the competitiveness of Fredericksburg-based projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the first question, the Smart Scale scores were independently calculated using the methodology prescribed in the November 2017 technical guide. These scores were then compared to the assigned project scores. In the overwhelming majority of projects the Smart Scale methodology was applied consistently and according to the technical guide specifications. In 39 of the 404 projects, however, there was a difference greater than 40% between assigned and calculated scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the second question, two alternative scenarios were used which both increased the importance of Accessibility in the  scoring calculation. All projects were scored according to the methodology defined in each scenario, and the percentile rankings of the Fredericksburg scores under each alternative scenario were compared to that obtained by the current methodology. There were small increases in percentile rankings of Fredericksburg project scores under the two alternative scenarios when compared to the current scoring methodology. This suggests that the full impact of Fredericksburg-based projects may be underestimated under the current Smart Scale methodology.\n",
    "\n",

    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Virginia Smart Scale methodology was finalized in November 2017 in order to provide an objective scoring system for the state's transportation projects competing for funding. The complete technical specification of the Smart Scale methodology can be found in the November 2017 technical guide, found here: [http://vasmartscale.org/documents/20171115/ss_technical_guide_nov13_2017.pdf](http://vasmartscale.org/documents/20171115/ss_technical_guide_nov13_2017.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is 1) to provide a descriptive statistical characterization of recently funded projects, 2) to independently assess whether the Smart Scale scores (abbreviated by SSS hereafter) assigned to these projects were consistent with the Smart Scale methodology as specified in the technical guide, and 3) to determine how increasing the emphasis on Accessibility (which is a major concern to the Fredericksburg area) in the SSS calculation methodology would impact the competitiveness of Fredericksburg-based projects. This analysis uses a dataset provided by the Fredericksburg Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (FAMPO), containing data on 404 projects. This analysis also uses the R statistical computing environment within a Jupyter notebook. This allows the analysis to be both explained as well as executed. It furthermore enables complete transparancy of the analytical methodology and code used in its execution. This removes any ambiguity and also guarantees reproducibility of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Data Inspection and Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was provided in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. This spreadsheet was first converted to a CSV file (ss-data.csv) and then a number of transformation processes were applied to clean and scale the data as well as to impute missing values. To begin, we first import several libraries which will be used later on and also define several functions which will be used in the data preparation:"

Within the data there are four area types: A, B, C, and D. Each of these area types has a unique factor weighting used in calculating in its Smart Scale Score. These weightings are specified for each area in Table 4.2 on page 36 within the technical guide. It is noted that for areas C and D, the Land Use factor is not used (or equivalently, carries 0% weight). Upon inspection of the whole dataset it was apparent that this was represented by empty cells for projects falling within these area types. Accordingly, all such Land Use values are set to 0. By this precedent it also is taken that all empty cells in numeric columns correspond to zero. Accordingly, a value of zero is imputed to all empty cells.\n",

Within the data there are four area types: A, B, C, and D. Each of these area types has a unique factor weighting that results in its Smart Scale Score. These weightings are specified for each area in Table 4.2 on page 36 within the technical guide. It is noted that for areas C and D, the Land Use factor is not used (or equivalently, carries 0% weight).\n",
    "\n",
    "The examination of scoring consistency will be accomplished by independently calculating the SSS score of each project according to the specifications in the technical guide.

    "\n",
    "In this section we examined whether the Smart Scale scoring methodology was consistently applied to the projects in the dataset by independently implementing the calculation method specified in the technical guide and comparing the results to the assigned Smart Scale score. The degree of agreement was determined using linear regression fitting the assigned score to the calculated score. The results suggest that in the overwhelming majority of projects the methodology was applied consistently and in conformance to the November 2017 technical guide. However, for 39 projects there was a large (>40%) difference between the calculated and assigned scores.\n",

    "## V. The Effect of Prioritizing Accessibility on Fredericksburg Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fredericksburg area is unique in that a large percentage of its workforce commutes outside the region. Accordingly, in this section we will examine the effect of two hypothetical scenarios which give priority to the Accessibility factor in calculating the Smart Scale Scores of projects in the Fredericksburg district. Specifically, three scenarios will be compared: 1) the current SSS calculation method as specified in the November 2017 technical guide, 2) a SSS calculation method that give priority to the Accessibility factor, and 3) a SSS calculation method that gives priority to the Accessibility factor while simultaneously increasing the Access to Jobs metric by a factor of 1.5 for projects in the Fredericksburg region (explained further below). In each case we will look at the number of Fredericksburg projects appearing in different percentile ranges by Smart Scale Score. These scenarios will be referred to as 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Accessibility factor is composed of the weighted average of three measures: 1) Access to Jobs (60%), 2) Access to Jobs for Disadvantaged Populations (20%), and 3) Access to Multimodal Choices (20%) (Nov. 2017 Technical Guide, p. 29). In Appendix C of the technical guide, the \"Access to Jobs\" measure is defined as the average increase in accessibility to jobs within 45 minutes. According to a recent study, approximately 37% of the workforce in Fredericksburg commutes outside the region, with more than 50% of these commuters commuting for an hour or more [1]. The vast majority of these commute to Northern VA, DC, Richmond, and Maryland - nearly all of which are beyond 45 minutes. A more appropriate measure for Fredericksburg would thus be to use a 75-minute reach or greater. Since there is no way to know how this reach would change the Access to Jobs without the GIS tool, an estimated increase of 1.5 times the current numbers will be used in scenario 3.\n",

    "In the first table above we see the counts of projects within the Fredericksburg district arranged by percentile under scenarios 1 (current), 2 (prioritization of Accessibility factor for area types A and D), and 3 (prioritization of Accessibility factor for area types A and D + 1.5x increased \"Access to Jobs\" measures for Fredericksburg district).

    "1. There is no major difference between scenarios 2 and 3. The 1.5x increase in \"Access to Jobs\", while leading to slightly higher average SSS in scenario 3 over scenario 2, was not enough to move the percentile ranks upward any further.\n",

There is a noticeable upward movement in Fredericksburg project SSS and percentile rank in scenarios which prioritize the Accessibility factor (i.e. in scenarios 2 and 3), with the 25-50%, 50-75%, and 95-100% bands seeing significant increases in the number of Fredericksburg projects. Of the 25 Fredericksburg projects in the dataset, two projects moved into the 50-75% band and two more moved into the very top band (95-100%). This is summarized by the small rise in average percentile rank from 4.48 under current calculation methodology up to 4.84 under the alternative methodologies in scenarios 2 and 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "The factor weightings currently used (as specified in the Nov. 2017 technical guide) place relatively low priority on the Accessibility factor in area types A and D and thus do not reflect the unique commuter conditions found in the Fredericksburg region. Accordingly, the full impact of Fredericksburg-based projects may be underestimated under the current Smart Scale Methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "## VI. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This study performed a statistical analysis on a set of 404 projects transportation scored using the Virginia Smart Scale methodology. Descriptive statistics were first provided which characterize the data over several project features. An analysis was then performed to see whether the Smart Scale methodology was applied consistently to the projects. The results indicate that the scoring methodolgy was applied consistently to the vast majority of projects. However, in 39 of the 404 projects there was a difference between calculated and assigned scores of more than 40%. Finally, the study considered whether increasing the emphasis on Accessibility in the scoring calculation would increase teh competitiveness of projects within the Fredericksburg area. The results indicate that increasing the emphasis on Accessibility would lead to small increases in average percentile ranking of Fredericksburg projects by Smart Scale Score. Accordingly, because Fredericksburg has such a large percentage of its workforce which commutes outside the area, the impact of Fredericksburg-based projects may be underestimated by using the current Smart Scale methodology.   \n",
