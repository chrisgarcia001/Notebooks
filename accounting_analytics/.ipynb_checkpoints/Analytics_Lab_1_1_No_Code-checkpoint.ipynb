    "# Analytics Lab 1-1: Predicting Bankruptcy Using Altman's Z\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keywords:** Predicting Bankruptcy, Distress, Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insight:** In 1968, Edward Altman published a paper predicting bankruptcyusing an analysis called Altman’s Z.  The basic terminology is still used today more than fifty years later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it a classification exercise? It’s because we are trying to put companies into classes, whether companies will be bankrupt or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base of his analysis predicts whether certain common business ratios could be used to classify bankrupt firms as compared to a matched sample of firms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Altman considered more than 20 possible ratios of firm performance, but the resulting analysis found that bankruptcy prediction is a linear combination of five common business ratios including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***X1 = Working capital / Total assets***: Measures how liquid, cash-like assets (or liquidity level in relation to the size of the company). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***X2 = Retained Earnings / Total assets***: Measures long-term profitability over the life of the company\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***X3 = Earnings before interest and taxes / Total assets***: Measures recent, or short-term profitability of the company\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ***X4 =  Market value of stockholders’ equity / Book value of total debt owed***: Long-term solvency of the company, or whether the company will have sufficient funds to pay its debt as it comes due.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ***X5 = Sales / Total Assets***: A measure of efficiency, or how well assets are utilized. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Required:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the Altman’s five factors used to predict bankruptcy.\n",
    "2. Weight each of those factors using Altman’s bankruptcy prediction weights to arrive at Altman’s Z score.\n",
    "3. Classify each company as either in the \"Distress Zone\", \"Gray Zone\" or \"Safe Zone\" for Bankruptcy using Altman’s classifications through use of a histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ask the Question:** Which companies do we predict will go bankrupt?\n",
