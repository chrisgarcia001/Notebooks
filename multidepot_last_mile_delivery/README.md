# Multi-Depot Last Mile Delivery

This notebook demonstrates how to use integer programming to solve the Multi-Depot Last Mile Delivery problem with a 
heterogeneus vehicle fleet. In this problem there are multiple depots from which trucks can fulfill customer orders, and 
customer orders can be split between multiple depots when advantageous or necessary. We show how to model, solve, and
visualize the optimal routes in Python using the [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/)  and [VeRoViz](https://veroviz.org/) packages.
